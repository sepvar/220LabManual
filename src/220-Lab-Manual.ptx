    <introduction>
    <title>Introduction</title>

    <p>Physics is a science which is based on precise measurements of the seven fundamental physical quantities, three of which are:
    time (in seconds), length (in meters) and mass (in kilograms); and all of these measurements have an experimental uncertainty
    associated with them.  It is very important for the experimenter to estimate these experimental uncertainties for every
    measurement taken.   There are three factors that must be taken into account when estimating the uncertainty of a measurement:
    <ol>
    <li><p>statistical variations in the measurements,</p></li>
    <li><p>using one-half of the smallest division on the measurement instrument,</p></li>
    <li><p>any mechanical motions of the apparatus.</p></li>
    </ol>
    Physicists study the physical relationships between these defined fundamental quantities and usually give a name to the
    newly derived physical quantity.  These derived physical quantities have units which are combinations of the units of the
    fundamental ones.  For example, the product of the lengths (in meters, m) of the three sides of a cube is called volume and
    has units of <m>\unit{m^3}</m>.  The ratio of mass to volume is called density and has units of
<quantity><unit prefix="kilo" base="gram" /><per base="meter" exp="3" /></quantity>.
    The concepts of volume and
    density are therefore derived from the fundamental physical quantities, rather than fundamental themselves.

    <title>Student Outcomes</title>

    <p>Knowledge Developed: In this exercise, students should learn how to make precise and accurate length measurements with a meter stick and
    two types of calipers, how to read a vernier scale, and how to estimate uncertainty in a measurement.   Students will make
    use of the relationship of the fundamental properties of mass and length to the derived concepts of volume and density.
    </p>

    <p>Skills Developed:
    <ul>
    <li><p>Proper use of a vernier caliper and scale</p></li>
    <li><p>Proper use of a micrometer caliper</p></li>
    <li><p>Evaluating and propagating uncertainties</p></li>

        <subsection>
    <title>The Vernier Caliper</title>

    <p>The vernier scale was invented by Pierre Vernier in 1631.   This scale has the advantage of enabling the user to
    determine one additional significant figure of precision over that of a straight ruler.</p>

    <p>For example, this eliminates the need for estimating to the tenth of a millimeter on the metric ruler.
    The vernier caliper, shown in <xref ref="f-vernier" text="type-global" />,
    can measure distances using three different parts of the caliper: outside diameters (large jaws), inside diameters (small jaws),
    and depths (probe).  You should locate these three places on your caliper.  The vernier device consists of the main scale and
    a movable vernier scale.  The fraction of a millimeter can be read off the vernier scale by choosing the mark on the
    vernier scale which best aligns with a mark on the main scale.</p>

        <figure xml:id="f-vernier">
        <title>The Vernier Caliper</title>
        <caption>
        The location of the zero on the vernier scale tells you where to read the centimeter scale (1.3 cm).
        The vernier-scale line that lines up tells you the next digit (5).  This picture measures <m>1.35\pm 0.01 \unit{cm}</m> because we can distinguish <m>1.35</m> from <m>1.34</m> and <m>1.36</m>, but we cannot gauge the result any more precisely.
        </caption>
        <image source="images/vernier.JPG" width="100%" />
        </figure>

    <p> To move the vernier scale relative to the main scale press down on the thumb-lock, this releases the lock and then
    move the vernier scale.   Do not try to move the vernier scale without releasing the lock. </p>

     </subsection>

    <subsection>
    <title>The Micrometer Caliper</title>

    <p> A micrometer caliper is shown in <xref ref="f-micrometer" text="type-global" />.
    This instrument is used for the precise length measurement of a small object.
    The object is placed with care between the anvil and the rod.  It is very important to not tighten down on the object with a vise-like grip.
    Tightening with force will <term>decalibrate</term> the micrometer (causing a zero-point error).
    The rotating cylinder moves the rod, opening or closing the rod onto the object.
    There is a rachet, at the far end, for taking up the slack distance between the anvil, the object and the rod, so again do not
    over-tighten with the rotating cylinder.  The linear dimension of the object can be read from the scale.  Rotating the cylinder
    one revolution moves the rod 0.5 millimeters.  The rotating cylinder has 50 marks on it.  Read the mark on the rotating cylinder
    that aligns with the central line on the main scale.</p>

        <figure xml:id="f-micrometer">
        <title>The Micrometer Caliper</title>
        <caption>Notice on the coarse scale, that the lower lines read (1, 2, 3, <ellipsis /> 6 in this picture) and the higher lines read
        the half-marks (0.5, 1.5, 2.5, <ellipsis /> 6.5 in this picture).  The location of the turning dial tells you where to read the
        coarse scale (6.5 mm).  The center line of the coarse scale tells you where to read the fine scale.
        This is 23.0 (in units of <m>\times 10^{-2}</m> mm), but not 23.5 and not 22.5 so the precision is 0.5 (in these units).
        This measurement in mm reads <m>6.5 \unit{mm} + 0.230\unit{mm} = 6.730 \pm 0.005 \unit{mm}</m>.
        Since each mark corresponds to <m>0.01 \unit{mm}</m> and you can probably gauge a distance about half-way between the lines,
	the precision of this instrument is <m>0.005\unit{mm}</m>.

                <statement>
                    <p>When you measure the diameter of a sphere, it might be difficult to get the caliper precisely at the full diameter.
                    If you are off, then you will necessarily be measuring a smaller value.  This is a systematic error that can be corrected for.
                    Since any mistake necessarily gives a value that is too small, then measuring it multiple times and finding the largest value
                    will minimize this uncertainty.</p>
                    <p>On the other hand, if you measure an egg, you would not expect the diameter to be the same.
                    Clearly for an egg, there is no reasonable single value to use as The Diameter.
                    In this case, the question of finding the diameter does not make sense, and by measuring in a systematic pattern,
                    you can determine that the shape is not spherical.</p>
                    <p>Determine if the zero-point error and the parallax error are <xref ref="p-random-systematic" text="title">random or systematic</xref>.</p>
                </statement>
                <hint><p>If a meterstick is worn down at the zero-value, then is it more likely to be measuring too short or too long?
                Is that <xref ref="p-random-systematic" text="title">systematic or random</xref>?</p></hint>
                <hint><p>For a measurement affected by parallax, is that <xref ref="p-random-systematic" text="title">systematic or random</xref>?</p></hint>
                <solution>
                    <p>Since random errors might give a result too big or too small,
                    measuring many times and averaging should minimize these errors.</p>
                    <p>Since systematic errors tend to be either too big or too small (in a predictable or explainable way),
                    you should track the uncertainties and recognize if this measurement
                    causes your result to be more likely too big or more likely too small.</p>

    <p><ul>
        <li><p> After finding the relevant dimensions of the object, calculate the volume of the object three times:
        once using the measurements from the ruler, once from the caliper, and once with the micrometer.
        <ul>
                <li><p>The volume of a rectangular block is <m>V = l w h</m> (length times width times height). You need to arbitrarily choose which dimension is which.</p></li>
                <li><p>The volume of a cylinder is <m>V = \pi r^2 h = \deq \frac{\pi D^2 h}{4}</m> (the cross-sectional area times the height).  Technically the formula is in terms of the radius, but it is more accurate to measure the diameter.</p></li>
                <li><p>The volume of a sphere is <m>V = \frac{4}{3} \pi R^2</m>. </p></li>
        </ul></p></li>
        <li><p> Using the <xref ref="ss-propagation" text="title">rules of propagation of uncertainty</xref>, compute the uncertainty in the volume for each.</p></li>

            <statement><p>Which instrument is the most precise?</p></statement>
            <hint><p>For which instrument can you measure to the most decimal places?</p></hint>
            <answer><p>Your data should give you this answer.  Your report should indicate how your data tells you the answer to this question.</p></answer>
            </exercise>
    <p><ul>
        <li><p> Measure the volume directly with the graduated cylinder.</p></li>
    </ul></p>
            <exercise>
            <statement>
                <p>Are any of the volume measurements inconsistent (See <xref ref="uncertainty-compare" text="type-global" /> about comparing values)?</p>
                <p>What can you infer about the accuracy of these instruments?</p>
                <p>Using the most precise indirect measurement of volume (those calculated from other measurements),
                calculate a <xref ref="difference" text="title">percent-difference</xref> with the direct measurement of volume.</p>
            </statement>
            <hint><p>When you measure the volume of (let's say the cylinder) with a meterstick, with a caliper, with a micrometer, and with a graduated cylinder, they are all measuring the volume of the same object, which does not change volume.  You <em>expect</em> these to all give the same number.  The question is whether or not <em>your data</em> do actually give the <q>same</q> values.</p></hint>
            <hint><p>Since you are using measurement techniques that have different precision, you will have different ranges of uncertainty.  Numbers are considered to be <q>the same</q> when their uncertainty ranges overlap.</p></hint>
            <hint><p>Keep in mind that <q>imprecise</q> means <q>a large range in the uncertainty</q>, whereas <q>inaccurate</q> means <q>inconsistent with the true value</q>.  (You might not know the true value.)</p></hint>
            <answer><p>It is possible that your data do not give consistent results for the volume.  You should notice if one result in particular is different than the others and then speculate on why <em>that</em> measurement is different.  If all of your results are inconsistent with each other, then you might want to check your measurements.  If they are again inconsistent, then you should check your results against a friend or the instructor.</p></answer>
            </exercise>
    <p><ul>
        <li><p> Measure the mass and then, using the overall most precise measurement of volume, compute the density
        with its uncertainty. </p></li>
        <li><p> Using your best density value, find the <xref ref="error" text="title">percent-error</xref> against the appropriate value given by the text,
        or the <em>Handbook of Physics <ampersand /> Chemistry</em>.</p></li>

            <exercise>
            <statement><p>What would be the best method to measure the volume of an irregularly shaped object?  Why?</p></statement>
            <hint><p>To answer this, it might help to think about <em>how</em> you would measure something that is irregularly shaped with each of the instruments you used today.  Is one of them particularly good at conforming to the shape of an irregularly shaped object?</p></hint>
            <answer><p>You should recognize which of the following objects (a meterstick, a caliper, a micrometer, and water) can touch all edges of an irregularly shaped object simultaneously.  On the other hand, if you are measuring the volume of something that is water-soluble, then you might want to reconsider your reasoning process.</p></answer>

<section><title>Procedure</title>
<p>There are several exercises and you will do them in different orders.
<ol>
        <li><p>Measure the length of the hallway from end to end by pacing it off.  Each person in the group should do this three times.  Indicate the variation of each person and the variation between people.  Devise a way to determine the distance in a more reliable unit. Submit your best guess for the actual distance.  The group that gets closest to the right answer gets 5 extra points on their report.  All groups that have the right value to within uncertainty also gets 5 extra points on their report.  </p></li>
        <li><p>One group at a time, collect 5 pennies.  Go outside, up the stairs, to the large flat grassy area (the <q>quad</q>).  Place all five pennies some place in the grass, all together and write out the location based on the number of paces.  Your written instructions should be intended to help somebody actually find the pennies: indicate an <q>origin</q>, choose a <q>coordinate system</q>, and give specific clear instructions for where to walk.  Your instructions must have at least one right-angle turn, but not more than three right-angle turns.  All turns must be right-angles.  Your group will have to secretly choose which lab-partner will be pacing off the steps and you are not allow to say <em>which</em> person it was.  When you return to lab, give your instructions to the professor, who will make copies and distribute them.  The assignment is for each group to collect one penny from each <q>treasure</q>.  At the end each group will go outside and find out how many pennies are missing from their buried treasure.</p></li>
        <li><p>Go out in the hallway and find a corner at ground level (just above the vertically oriented bricks).
            <ul>
                <li><p>From this location, count five bricks over and fifteen bricks up.  Mark that brick with a piece of chalk.</p></li>
            </ul>
            If our count were off by <m>\pm 1\unit{brick}</m> for every five bricks, then our measurements are actually <m>5\pm 1\unit{brick}</m> and <m>15\pm3\unit{bricks}</m>.
            <ul>
                <li><p>Repeat your attempt to identify the same brick but this time go over four <m>(5-1)</m> and up twelve <m>(15-3)</m>.  This is the smallest error.</p></li>
                <li><p>Repeat your attempt to identify the same brick but this time go over six <m>(5+1)</m> and up eighteen <m>(15+3)</m>.  This is the largest error.</p></li>
            </ul>
            We might also make mixed errors where one is too large but the other is too small.
            <ul>
                <li><p>Repeat your attempt to identify the original brick but this time go over four <m>(5-1)</m> and up eighteen <m>(15+3)</m>. </p></li>
                <li><p>Repeat your attempt to identify the original brick but this time go over six <m>(5+1)</m> and up twelve <m>(15-3)</m>.</p></li>
            </ul>
            Identify the size of the region by finding the area of this region in terms of <m>\unit{bricks^2}</m>, that is, multiply the width of bricks by the height of bricks in this region.
            </p></li>
        <li><p>Use PASCO to measure your speed.</p></li>
        <li><p>I have a horse who is 17.2 hands.  Use the internet to find out if a 17-hand horse is large or small.  Determine what this number measures.  How many <q>hands</q> is your lab table?  What is this number in the metric system?  Each of these numbers should be accompanied by a measure of the precision.</p></li>
</ol></p>

        <li><p>Using position versus time and velocity versus time graphs, verify
        <ul>
                <li><p>that the equations of constant acceleration accurately describe the behavior of objects under constant acceleration and </p></li>

    <section xml:id="s-acceleration-outcomes"><title>Student Outcomes</title>
    <p>Knowledge developed: In this exercise, the student should develop an understanding of the relationships between the position and the
        instantaneous velocity of an object, as well as how each of these can vary as functions of time.
        We will only consider the special case where the object experiences constant acceleration.</p>

    <p>Skills developed:
        <ul>
        <li><p>Evaluate the data for sources of uncertainty. Can you see an effect, such as a level track or the presence of friction, in the result?</p></li>

                <p><alert>Materials</alert>: An aluminum track, a low-friction cart, computer interface with PASCO Capstone<m>^{\rm tm}</m> software, a sonic motion sensor, a small steel ball.</p>

                <p>You should notice that the subsections in this section parallel the subsections in <xref ref="ss-AccAnalysis" text="title" />.</p>

You should start becoming familiar with the hardware and software.</p></aside>
        <p>Log into the computer (so you can save your data to your network drive) and then open Pasco Capstone.
        (<xref ref="s-capstone" text="type-global" /> will provide some instructions for setting up the software and connecting the equipment.)
        Connect the motion sensor to the computer interface.
        Set the data rate of the motion sensor at <m>50 \unit{Hz}</m>.
        Place a steel ball on the track and adjust the leveling screw at one end of the track to see if the ball rolls one way or the other.
        This will roughly level your track.
        Place the sensor about 20 cm from the end of the track, because this is the minimum distance detected by the sensor.
        (You might need to use the <q>sail</q> for the sensor to see the cart.)</p>

        <p>Place the cart on the track.  Capstone, via the sonic ranger, can measure the position and velocity of the cart as a function of time.

        <p>We will take four sets of data: a slow, constant velocity towards the ranger; a slow, constant velocity away from the ranger;
        a faster, constant velocity towards the ranger; and a faster, constant velocity away from the ranger.
        The two slow speeds should be about the same and the two faster speeds should be about the same.
        For each case, start the sonic ranger and then bump the cart firmly, but not violently(!).</p>

        <p>On Capstone, you should have four curves of velocity versus time.
        Fit each with a trendline and display the equation of the trendline on the screen.
        Interpret the coefficients (slope and intercept) by noting their units, values, and uncertainties.
        You should also print out (in landscape mode) the position versus time graph, the velocity versus time graph,
        and the acceleration versus time graph.  (You should notice that the acceleration versus time graph is <em>very</em> noisy.)</p>

        <p>We will consider <em>three cases</em> for the sloped track: <em>First</em>, allow the cart to roll

<chapter xml:id="c-Newton"> <title>Newton's <m>2^{\rm nd}</m> Law on a Linear Track with the Sonic Ranger</title>

    <objectives>
    <introduction><p>In this experiment, we will assume that Newton's first law is true and focus on Newton's second law.</p></introduction>
    <ul>
    <li><p>By measuring
        <ul>
        <li><p>the velocity versus time for a cart being pulled down a track and</p></li>
        <li><p>the applied force that is pulling it, </p></li>
        </ul>
        we can plot the acceleration versus the force and verify the validity of Newton's second law of motion: <m>\vec F_{\rm net} = m \vec a</m>.</p></li>
    </ul>
    </objectives>

<introduction><title>Introduction to Forces</title>
    <p>Forces are related to the natural motion of bodies, where one object can affect the motion of another object.
    That is, forces are interactions between objects affecting their motion.
    Although the famous Greek philosopher Aristotle claimed that a force was necessary to <em>maintain</em> any motion,
    careful analysis by Italian physicist Galileo Galilei in the mid-<m>17^{\rm th}</m> century and by Sir Isaac Newton,
    a British mathematician and physicist (1642-1727), eventually distinguished the effects of friction and allowed
    Newton to create a mathematically consistent theory of motion.  These concepts were published in Newton's book
    <q>Mathematical Principles of Natural Philosophy</q> in 1687, for which (among other accomplishments) Newton is
    regarded as one of the greatest scientists of all time.</p>

    <p>All forces can be placed in one of two main categories.
    First, there are natural (or fundamental) forces like the gravitational force, the electromagnetic force, or the nuclear forces.
    The gravitational force is a force on a body by another body (like the Earth), this force is an interaction between their two masses.
    The electromagnetic force is an interaction between the charges of two bodies.
    These forces may act on an object without any direct physical contact between the two bodies.
    This type of force is sometimes called an <q>action at a distance</q> force.
    All other forces are in a second category called <q>contact forces.</q></p>

        <p><alert>Newton's First Law:</alert></p>
        <blockquote>
        <p>If there are no forces acting, then objects will remain at rest or, if not at rest, will maintain their velocity.</p>
        </blockquote>
        <p>If this is true, then we can study the forces acting on a body based on the motion of the body,
        specifically through the change in the velocity of an object.</p>

        <p><alert>Newton's Second Law:</alert> Not only is a force necessary to change the motion (to cause an acceleration),
        the amount of acceleration that a force causes is predictable and is inversely proportional to the mass.
        The same sized force causes a small mass to accelerate a lot and a large mass to accelerate a little.
        This is expressed by the equation:
        <me> \vec F_{\rm net} = m \vec a. </me>
        The net force, <m>\vec F_{\rm net}</m>, is the vector sum of all forces acting on an object.
        If we have an extended object (such as a weight hanging off of a table, but connected to a cart that is on the table),
        then we need only consider forces that are <q>external</q> to the system:
        So long as both objects accelerate at the same rate, we do not need to consider the <q>internal</q> tension that
        the string exerts between the connected bodies.</p>

    <p><alert>Newton's Third Law:</alert> Inherent in the description of a force is that it is an interaction between objects:
    there must always be two objects that interact.  These objects exert equal and opposite forces on each other.  That is,</p>
    <blockquote>
        <p>If there is a force exerted on object 1 by object 2, then there is necessarily and simultaneously
        a force exerted on object 2 by object 1 that is equal (in magnitude) and opposite (in direction) to the original force.</p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>Remember that these two forces are on different objects and that the two bodies in direct contact exert forces on each other.
    Remember then that if there is contact between the object (any part of the system) and anything else then there is an
    outside force on the object (system) and that if there is no contact (the two bodies break contact) then there is no force.</p>

    <li><p> You should be prepared to derive an equation for the acceleration of the system, in terms of, the mass of the cart and the hanging mass, while assuming that the cart has no friction with the track.  (Hint: There is only one force accelerating the system.) </p></li>

    <title>Student Outcomes</title>

    <p>Knowledge Developed: In this exercise, students should learn how forces are related to the motion of a cart, how to use a free-body diagram, and gain a visceral understanding of Newton's second law.
    </p>

    <p>Skills Developed:
    <ul>
        <li><p>Evaluate the data for sources of uncertainty. Can you see an effect, such as a level track or the presence of friction, in the result?</p></li>
        <li><p>Using Pasco Capstone software</p></li>
        <li><p>Interpreting slope and intercept of graphs</p></li>
    </ul>

    </section>



<section xml:id="s-newton-procedure"><title>Procedure</title>

<subsection xml:id="NII-Setup"><title>The Experimental Setup</title>

<paragraphs><title>Materials</title>
<p>A low-friction linear track with a wheeled cart and a pulley at one end of the track. Weights that can ride in the cart without jostling.  A string connecting the cart to a light-weight support for small masses, which sits over the pulley allowing the masses to fall vertically while pulling the cart horizontally. A <q>sonic ranger</q> that uses sonar to measure the position, velocity, and acceleration of the cart.</p>
</paragraphs>

    <p><ul>
    <li><p> A low-friction linear cart and track will be used, this reduces the friction between the cart and the track.</p></li>
    <li><p> A string will be connected to the cart and a known mass will be hanging from the end of the string (and over a pulley).
        The hanging mass will exert a constant horizontal force on the cart as the mass falls all the way to the floor.  This gives a constant acceleration to the cart.</p></li>
    <li><p> The sonic motion sensor will be used to measure the position of the cart as a function of time. </p></li>
    <li><p> The carts and tracks need to be handled with care.  Scratches can add friction to the system.</p></li>
    </ul></p>

</subsection>

<subsection><title>Procedure</title>
    <p>
    <ul>
    <li><p> If the cart is given an initial push (without the hanging mass and string attached) then the cart should travel
        with a constant velocity down the horizontal track, if there are no other forces acting on the cart.
        Carry out  a couple of constant velocity runs on the track, to check for the effects of friction and
        to see how level the track is. The track may need a level adjustment.  Do runs in both directions.
        Maybe the track can be tilted so that the friction is countered by the tilt of the track.</p>
        <p>It might help to review Exercises <xref ref="q-frictionless-unlevel" text="global" />, <xref ref="q-frictionless-level" text="global" />, and <xref ref="q-friction-level" text="global" /> from the <xref ref="c-acceleration" text="title" /> lab.</p></li>
    <li><p> Connect a string to the cart and run it over a pulley.
        Measure the height of the string at both ends of the track, to ensure that the string is as level as the track.</p></li>
    </ul>
    </p>
    <exercise>
    	<statement><p>If the pulley has a very large wheel or is set so that the string is low at the cart, but high at the pulley, then the force pulling the cart is not horizontal.  Draw the free-body diagram for the cart in this case.  Comment on if this increases, decreases, or does not affect each of the other forces (<m>F_\mathrm{normal}</m>, <m>F_\mathrm{gravity}</m>, <m>F_\mathrm{friction}</m>). </p>
    	</statement>
    	<hint><p>If the tension pulls up, then the normal force does not need to support all of the weight.</p></hint>
    	<hint><p>If the tension pulls slightly up, is there a convenient way to find then angle at which it pulls?  Will that angle depend on how close the cart is to the pulley?</p></hint>

<introduction><title>Introduction</title>

    <p>Friction is a force which retards the relative motion of any body while sliding over another body.
    The frictional force acting on a body is parallel to the surface that the object is sliding upon and it is
    directed opposite to the direction of motion.  The phenomenon of friction is rather complicated, especially
    at the microscopic level, because it is dependent on the nature of the materials of both contacting surfaces.
    The frictional force depends on the roughness or the irregularities of both surfaces.
    At the macroscopic level, the nature of this force can be described by a simple empirical law, first given by Leonardo da Vinci:</p>
    <blockquote>
    <p>The magnitude of the force of friction between unlubricated, dry surfaces sliding one over the other is
    proportional to the normal force pressing the surfaces together and is independent of the (macroscopic) area of contact
    and of the relative speed.</p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>At the microscopic level, the frictional force <m>(F_f)</m> does depend on the actual area of contact of the
    irregularities of the surfaces.  This actual area of contact then increases as the force pressing the two surfaces
    together increases, this force is called the load.  Using Newton's <m>2^{\rm nd}</m> Law in this perpendicular
    direction we can conclude that the magnitude of the load is equal to the Normal force <m>(F_N)</m> of the surface pushing on the object.
    Therefore we may write that
    <me>
    F_f \propto F_N
    \hspace{.75cm} \Rightarrow \hspace{.75cm}
    F_f = \mu F_N
    </me>
    where the Greek letter <m>\mu</m> (<q>mew</q>) is a dimensionless constant of proportionality called the coefficient of friction.</p>

    <p>When a body is pushed or pulled parallel to the surface of contact and no motion occurs,
    we can conclude that the force of the push or pull is equal to the frictional force, using Newton's <m>2^{\rm nd}</m> Law of motion.
    As the applied force is increased, the frictional force remains equal to the applied force until motion results.
    At this maximum value of the applied force, the frictional force is also a maximum and is given by
    <me>
    F_f = \mu_s F_N
    </me>
    where the subscript <m>s</m> stands for static (non-moving) friction, and <m>\mu_s</m> is <term>the coefficient of static friction</term>.
    This equation can only be used at this maximum static point also called the point of impending motion.
    At the instant that the applied force becomes greater than the maximum <m>f_s</m>, the body is set into motion
    and this motion is opposed by a frictional force called the kinetic (sliding) frictional force and is given by
    <me>
    F_f = \mu_k F_N
    </me>
    where the subscript <m>k</m> stands for the kinetic (moving) friction, and <m>\mu_k</m> is <term>the coefficient of kinetic friction</term>.
    In general, <m>\mu_k \lt \mu_s</m>; that is, it takes more force to overcome the static friction than to overcome the kinetic friction.
    The coefficients of friction are generally less than one, but may be greater than one, and they depend on the nature of both surfaces.</p>


	<p>Consider a system comprised of a block on a horizontal surface being pulled horizontally by a string connected to a hanging weight.
    We can use <m>M</m> is the mass of the block on the horizontal surface and <m>m</m> is the hanging mass.  The force that accelerates the system forward is <m>mg</m>.  The frictional force depends on the normal force of the block <m>\mu_k (Mg)</m>.  Then, the whole system is accelerating with a constant acceleration so that Newton's second law gives:
    <men xml:id="eq-Newton-second"> (mg) + [-(\mu_kMg)] = (M+m)a </men>.
    From this, <m>\mu_k</m> can be solved for, giving:
    <men xml:id="eq-Newton-mu">
    \mu_k  = \frac{ mg - (M+m) a }{ Mg}
    </men>.

    <p>The experimental precision should be estimated for all parts of this experiment and care should be taken for all of the measurements.  , but it is more important to investigate the relationships than it is to repeat the experiment many times or to try to achieve high precision in the data.  In <xref ref="ex-friction-while-accelerating" text="type-global" /> you found an equation for <m>F_f</m> in terms of measured values.  You should track the uncertainties from measurement, through the calculation, to the result (this is called the <xref ref="ss-propagation" text="title" />) so that you can see how the uncertainty in the measurements impact the uncertainty of the final result.  The following will step you through how it would work for <xref ref="eq-Newton-mu" text="type-global">Equation</xref>, which is much more complicated than your equation.</p>
    <example>
        <statement>
        <p>In order to propagate the uncertainty for <m>\displaystyle \mu_k  = \frac{ mg - (M+m) a }{ Mg}</m> we should notice that it has both addition (See <xref ref="add" text="type-global">Rule</xref>) and multiplication (See <xref ref="mult" text="type-global">Rule</xref>).
        I will assume some values with uncertainty; I will also list the relative uncertainty:
        <ul>
          <li><m>m=0.30 \pm 0.01 \unit{kg}</m>, <m>\displaystyle \frac{0.01 \unit{kg}}{0.30\unit{kg}} = 0.033 = 3.3\%</m></li>
          <li><m>M=2.50 \pm 0.02 \unit{kg}</m>, <m>\displaystyle \frac{0.02 \unit{kg}}{2.50\unit{kg}} = 0.008 = 0.8\%</m></li>
          <li><m>a=0.45 \pm 0.04 \unitfrac{m}{s^2}</m>, <m>\displaystyle \frac{0.04 \unitfrac{m}{s^2}}{0.45\unitfrac{m}{s^2}} = 0.089 = 8.9\%</m></li>
          <li><m>g=9.81 \pm 0.01 \unitfrac{m}{s^2}</m>, <m>\displaystyle \frac{0.01 \unitfrac{m}{s^2}}{9.81\unitfrac{m}{s^2}} = 0.001 = 0.1\%</m></li>
        </ul>
        You should note that while the uncertainty of <m>m</m> and <m>M</m> are about the same, the relative uncertainty of <m>m</m> is much larger than the relative uncertainty of <m>M</m> (and similarly for <m>a</m> and <m>g</m>).  While the uncertainty for <m>m</m> and <m>g</m> have the same numeric value, they cannot be meaningfully compared because they have different units.</p>

        <p> Recall the <q>order of operations</q> implies that we <alert>first</alert> add <m>(M+m)</m>, <alert>then</alert> multiply that value by <m>a</m>, <alert>then</alert> add that value to (the product of) <m>mg</m>, and <alert>finally</alert> divide by (the product of) <m>Mg</m>.  We do the propagation of uncertainty in the same order.</p>

        <p>Using <xref ref="add" text="type-global">Rule</xref>, add the masses <m>(M+m)</m>:
                <md>
                <mrow>(0.30 \pm 0.01 \unit{kg}) + (2.50 \pm 0.02 \unit{kg}) \amp = [(0.30+2.50) \pm (0.01+0.02)]\unit{kg} </mrow>
                <mrow> \amp = 2.80 \pm 0.03 \unit{kg}</mrow>
                </md>
                <me>\displaystyle \frac{0.03 \unit{kg}}{2.80\unit{kg}} = 0.011 = 1.1\%</me>
        This overall uncertainty is affected a little bit more by <m>M</m> (in this case) because we are adding uncertainty (not relative uncertainty).</p>

        <p>Using <xref ref="mult" text="type-global">Rule</xref>, multiply by the acceleration <m>(M+m)a</m>:
                <md>
                <mrow>(2.80 \pm 0.03 \unit{kg})(0.45 \pm 0.04 \unitfrac{m}{s^2}) \amp = [(2.80\unit{kg})(0.45\unitfrac{m}{s^2}] \pm [(0.011+0.089)] </mrow>
                <mrow> \amp = 1.26 \unit{N} \pm [0.10]</mrow>
                </md>,
        since <m>(1.26\unit{N})(0.10) = 0.126\unit{N}</m>, this is <m>1.26 \pm 0.13 \unit{N}</m>.<fn>If this were the final answer, you should report it as <m>1.3 \pm 0.1\unit{N}</m>; but since we are continuing to use it in calculations, for the purpose of managing appropriate rounding errors, you can keep an extra insignificant digit, which will maintain consistency.  Please be sure to round your final answer to the appropriate number of significant digits.</fn> In this case, <m>a</m> contributed about <m>8</m> times as much uncertainty.<fn xml:id="fn-precision-of-a">To improve this answer we should focus on a more precise measurement of <m>a</m>, rather than improving the precision of <m>m</m> or <m>M</m>!</fn>
        </p>

        <p>We also need to use <xref ref="mult" text="type-global">Rule</xref> to find the uncertainty for <m>mg</m> before combining the numerator:
                <md>
                <mrow>(0.30 \pm 0.01 \unit{kg})(9.81 \pm 0.01 \unitfrac{m}{s^2}) \amp = [(0.30\unit{kg})(9.81\unitfrac{m}{s^2}] \pm [(0.033+0.001)] </mrow>
                <mrow> \amp = 2.94 \unit{N} \pm [0.034]</mrow>
                </md>,
        since <m>(2.94\unit{N})(0.034) = 0.10\unit{N}</m>, this is <m>2.94 \pm 0.10 \unit{N}</m>.<fn>If this were the final answer, you should report it as <m>2.9 \pm 0.1\unit{N}</m>; but since we are continuing to use it in calculations, for the purpose of managing appropriate rounding errors, you can keep an extra insignificant digit, which will maintain consistency.  Please be sure to round your final answer to the appropriate number of significant digits.</fn> Notice that the mass had a larger impact on the uncertainty of this term.</p>

        <p>Using <xref ref="add" text="type-global">Rule</xref>, subtract<fn>Remember the rule is to <alert>add</alert> the uncertainty even if you are <alert>subtracting</alert> the values!</fn> the two terms in the numerator [<m>mg</m> and <m>(M+m)a</m>]:
                <md>
                <mrow>(2.94 \pm 0.10 \unit{N}) - (1.26 \pm 0.13 \unit{N}) \amp = [(2.94-1.26) \pm (0.10+0.13)]\unit{N} </mrow>
                <mrow> \amp = 1.68 \pm 0.23 \unit{N}</mrow>
                </md>
                <me>\displaystyle \frac{0.23 \unit{N}}{1.68\unit{N}} = 0.14 = 14\%</me>
        Notice that both terms had a similar contribution to the uncertainty.<fn xml:id="fn-fixing-precision">Even if we improved the precision of <m>a</m>, as mentioned in <xref ref="fn-precision-of-a" text="type-global" />, the uncertainty of <m>mg</m> would keep this uncertainty near the <m>0.1</m> to <m>0.2</m> range.  So we need to be more precise with <m>m</m> for the <m>mg</m> term <em>and</em> with <m>a</m> for the <m>(M+m)a</m> term.</fn></p>

        <p>Finally, use <xref ref="mult" text="type-global">Rule</xref> to find the uncertainty for the final combination<fn>Remember the rule is to <alert>add</alert> the relative uncertainty whether you are multiplying <alert>or</alert> dividing the values!</fn> of the numerator/denominator:
                <md>
                <mrow>\frac{(1.68 \pm 0.23 \unit{N})}{(2.50 \pm 0.02 \unit{kg})(9.81 \pm 0.01 \unitfrac{m}{s^2})} \amp = [\frac{1.68\unit{N}}{(2.50\unit{kg})(9.81\unitfrac{m}{s^2})}] \pm [(0.14+0.008+0.001)] </mrow>
                <mrow> \amp = 0.0685 \pm [0.15]</mrow>
                </md>,
        since <m>(0.0685\unit{N})(0.15) = 0.010\unit{N}</m>, this is <m>0.07 \pm 0.01 = (7 \pm 1)\ten{-2}</m>, rounded to the appropriate number of significant digits.</p>

        <p>You should note that the uncertainty of the numerator swamps by far the uncertainty of the denominator.  In order to make this measurement more precise, we should focus on improving the precision of <m>m</m> and <m>a</m>, as indicated in <xref ref="fn-fixing-precision" text="type-global" />.</p>

    <objectives>
    <ul>
    <li><p>The purpose of this experiment will be to verify the validity of the law of conservation of mechanical energy,
    which says that <m>\Delta E = 0</m> as a cart runs along a track.</p></li>
    </ul>
    </objectives>

<introduction><title>Introduction</title>

    <p>Conservation laws play a very important role in our understanding of our physical world.
    For example, the law of conservation of energy can be applied in all physical processes.
    This is a fundamental and independent statement about the nature of the physical world.
    It is not necessarily derivable from other laws like Newton's Laws of motion.
    Though for simple point mass systems, the law of conservation of energy can be derived from Newton's Laws.
    It can be shown that the net work done on a system is equal to the change in the kinetic energy
    <m>(W_{\rm net} = \Delta K)</m> of the system; this is called the work-energy theorem and it can be written in a variety of forms.
    When a net positive work is done on a system, the kinetic energy of the system increases, and
    when a net negative work is done on the system (as from a friction force), the kinetic energy of the system decreases.</p>

    <p>When the gravitational force acts on a system, the work it does on the system,
    <m>W_g</m>, is the gravitational force <m>(mg)</m> times the vertical displacement <m>(h=\Delta y)</m>: <m>W_g=mg\Delta y</m>.
    For convenience, this is called the change in gravitational potential energy <m>(W_g = - \Delta P)</m>.
    <em>If</em> the gravitational force is the only force acting on the system then <m>W_g = W_{\rm net}</m> and
    therefore, <m>-\Delta P = \Delta K</m> for the system.  When a force can be associated with a potential energy,
    it is called a <q>conservative force.</q>  Another kind of potential energy deals with an elastic potential energy,
    like in a spring.  The energy stored in a spring is given by the formula <m>P_s = \frac{1}{2} k \Delta x^2</m>.</p>

    <p><em>If</em>, on the other hand, a force dissipates energy, then it is called a <q>nonconservative force</q> and
    it will have no associated potential energy.  Frictional forces are an example of a nonconservative force and the
    work done by a frictional force is negative because (physically) the frictional force removes energy from the system
    and (mathematically) the frictional force and the displacement are in opposite directions.
    This work done by friction is converted into heat or sound.
    To distinguish the energy of heat or sound from the potential and kinetic energy, we define the total mechanical energy,
    <m>E=K+P</m> at any point.  Since frictional forces remove mechanical energy, we say <m>W_f = \Delta E = \Delta K + \Delta P</m>.</p>

    <p>In general then, the law of conservation of energy states that energy can not be created or destroyed,
    but can only change from one form to another; or the total energy of the system at point A is equal to the
    total energy of the system at point B.</p>

    </introduction>

<section xml:id="s-energy1-procedure"><title>Procedure</title>

    <introduction>
    <p>We would like for you to verify the conservation of mechanical energy in two different situations;
    so, there are two parts to this experiment.  We will first consider a flat track with accelerated motion,
    as in the Newton's Law lab and the Friction lab.  We can then consider an inclined plane.
    You will not be given an explicit procedure, but rather you will be given a series of questions with answers
    that will imply the procedure.  Part of the experiment is for you to figure out for yourself what the best
    course of action is.  Please answer the questions as they are asked.</p>

<!--  <aside>
    <title>NOTE:</title>
        <p>There is enough analysis for this lab that you will have two weeks to complete the lab.
        During the first week, you will do the two parts of the experiment and begin to write up your report.
        During the second week, you will do some analysis and re-run the experiment to determine the cause of
        differences from expectations.  A single lab report will be due after the second week of experimentation.

    <subsection xml:id="sss-1flat"><title>Flat Track</title>

        <p>Set up the dynamics cart on a horizontal dynamics track.
        Set up the motion sensor at one end of the track and a pulley at the other end so that the pulley
        partly extends past the edge of the table.  Hang the basket over the pulley so that it can
        accelerate the cart along the track -- you might need extra weight in the cart to keep it
        from accelerating too fast.  In order to use this motion to verify the validity of the conservation
        of mechanical energy, we need to measure some variables.
        Answering <xref ref="q-1KE" text="type-global" /> and <xref ref="q-1PE" text="type-global" /> will help you decide on the relevant variables.
        <xref ref="q1-2or1" text="type-global" /> should help you determine how to finish setting up the equipment.</p>

            that you actually need.</p></statement>

        <p>Once you decide what variables to measure, run the experiment for one set of masses while measuring the appropriate variables.
        Put the data into Excel and decide what plot(s) will allow you to verify the validity of the conservation of mechanical energy.

    <em>Ask for help from the instructor!</em>  The catch-bar has magnets in it that will repel the magnets in the cart.
    In this case, the cart must not be going so fast as to come into physical contact with the magnets on the catch-bar.</p>

    <p>Raise one end of the dynamics track.  <xref ref="q-1slope" text="type-global" /> should help decide how tilted.
    Measure the tilt angle of the track with two methods: use a protractor, and measure the vertical rise and track length and
    calculate the tilt angle using the inverse-sine function.  Answer <xref ref="q-1anglemeasurement" text="type-global" />.
    As you continue to set up the track for measurements, consider answering <xref ref="q-1KE" text="type-global" />, <xref ref="q-1PE" text="type-global" />,
    and <xref ref="q1-2or1" text="type-global" /> again for this situation to help you decide on the appropriate accessories (sensors);
    but note <xref ref="q-1rampangle" text="type-global" /> as you think about the answers to the previous questions.</p>

        <exercise xml:id="q-1slope">
            <statement><p>  We want the cart to accelerate down the track (not too slow), but not to fly off
            at the bottom (not too fast).  How fast is <em>too fast</em>?  Don't use that slope!  How fast is <em>too slow</em>?
            Use a slope somewhere in between.</p></statement>
        </exercise>
        <exercise xml:id="q-1anglemeasurement">
            <statement><p>  After you measure the angle of incline in these two ways, consider the
            uncertainty in the measurements.  Which of these measurement is more precise?</p></statement>
        </exercise>
        <exercise xml:id="q-1rampangle">
            <statement><p>  The motion sensor will measure the motion of the cart <em>along</em> the ramp,
            but the potential energy needs the <em>vertical</em> position of the cart.
            Which trig function relates the distance along the ramp to the corresponding vertical distance?</p></statement>
        </exercise>

    <p>Once you decide on the variables to be measured, but before you make the measurements,
    you will need to calibrate your position measurements.  We would like zero to correspond to being at the bottom of the ramp,
    so place the cart stationary at the bottom and use the motion sensor to measure this position.
    In order to verify the validity of the conservation of mechanical energy, release the cart from rest near the top of the ramp and
    let it roll down the incline, bouncing three times before you stop the measurement.  Do this for one value of mass.

    <p>Transfer these data to Excel again and decide on the best graph to verify the objective.
    Again, <xref ref="q-1plots" text="type-global" /> may help with this; however, you will also need to consider
    <xref ref="q-1bounce" text="type-global" />.  Decide if you need a trendline and where it would be fit.

    </objectives>

<introduction><title>Introduction</title>

    <p>Conservation laws play a very important role in our understanding of our physical world.
    For example, the law of conservation of energy can be applied in all physical processes.
    This is a fundamental and independent statement about the nature of the physical world.
    It is not necessarily derivable from other laws like Newton's Laws of motion.
    Though for simple point mass systems, the law of conservation of energy can be derived from Newton's Laws.
    It can be shown that the net work done on a system is equal to the change in the kinetic energy
    <m>(W_{\rm net} = \Delta K)</m> of the system; this is called the work-energy theorem and it can be written in a variety of forms.
    When a net positive work is done on a system, the kinetic energy of the system increases, and
    when a net negative work is done on the system (as from a friction force), the kinetic energy of the system decreases.</p>

    <p>When the gravitational force acts on a system, the work it does on the system,
    <m>W_g</m>, is the gravitational force <m>(mg)</m> times the vertical displacement <m>(h=\Delta y)</m>: <m>W_g=mg\Delta y</m>.
    For convenience, this is called the change in gravitational potential energy <m>(W_g = - \Delta P)</m>.
    <em>If</em> the gravitational force is the only force acting on the system then <m>W_g = W_{\rm net}</m> and
    therefore, <m>-\Delta P = \Delta K</m> for the system.  When a force can be associated with a potential energy,
    it is called a <q>conservative force.</q>  Another kind of potential energy deals with an elastic potential energy,
    like in a spring.  The energy stored in a spring is given by the formula <m>P_s = \frac{1}{2} k \Delta x^2</m>.</p>

    <p><em>If</em>, on the other hand, a force dissipates energy, then it is called a <q>nonconservative force</q> and
    it will have no associated potential energy.  Frictional forces are an example of a nonconservative force and the
    work done by a frictional force is negative because (physically) the frictional force removes energy from the system
    and (mathematically) the frictional force and the displacement are in opposite directions.
    This work done by friction is converted into heat or sound.
    To distinguish the energy of heat or sound from the potential and kinetic energy, we define the total mechanical energy,
    <m>E=K+P</m> at any point.  Since frictional forces remove mechanical energy, we say <m>W_f = \Delta E = \Delta K + \Delta P</m>.</p>

    <p>In general then, the law of conservation of energy states that energy can not be created or destroyed,
    but can only change from one form to another; or the total energy of the system at point A is equal to the
    total energy of the system at point B.</p>

    </introduction>

<section xml:id="s-energy2-procedure"><title>Procedure</title>

    <introduction>
    <p>We would like for you to verify the conservation of mechanical energy in two different situations;
    so, there are two parts to this experiment.  We will first consider a flat track with accelerated motion,
    as in the Newton's Law lab and the Friction lab.  We can then consider an inclined plane.
    You will not be given an explicit procedure, but rather you will be given a series of questions with answers
    that will imply the procedure.  Part of the experiment is for you to figure out for yourself what the best
    course of action is.  Please answer the questions as they are asked.</p>

    <aside><title>NOTE:</title>
        <p>There is enough analysis for this lab that you will have two weeks to complete the lab.
        During the first week, you will do the two parts of the experiment and begin to write up your report.
        During the second week, you will do some analysis and re-run the experiment to determine the cause of
        differences from expectations.  A single lab report will be due after the second week of experimentation.
        </p>

    </introduction>
    <subsection xml:id="sss-flat"><title>Flat Track</title>

        <p>Set up the dynamics cart on a horizontal dynamics track.
        Set up the motion sensor at one end of the track and a pulley at the other end so that the pulley
        partly extends past the edge of the table.  Hang the basket over the pulley so that it can
        accelerate the cart along the track -- you might need extra weight in the cart to keep it
        from accelerating too fast.  In order to use this motion to verify the validity of the conservation
        of mechanical energy, we need to measure some variables.
        Answering <xref ref="q-KE" text="type-global" /> and <xref ref="q-PE" text="type-global" /> will help you decide on the relevant variables.

                    the values of position become negative (less than zero!).  Why?  Is there some other place where the energy might go?

                        If you are using the force transducer, then it has a spring and a spring potential energy, <m>\Delta P_{\rm spring}</m>.
                        This can (and should!) also be included in the total mechanical energy.
                        You can calculate the elastic potential energy stored in the spring of the force transducer with
                        <m>P = \frac{1}{2} k \Delta x^2</m>, which, since we do not know <m>k</m>, can be written
                        <m>P = \frac{1}{2} F \Delta x</m>, where F is the force in Newtons (measurable with the force transducer) and
                        <m>\Delta x</m> is the distance from the spring's equilibrium position, not the height (derivable from the position data).
                        Be sure to match up the force values and the <m>x</m> values at those same times.

    <subsection xml:id="sss-sloped"><title>Sloped Track</title>

    <p>Remove the pulley from the track.  Your cart will have either a spring-loaded <q>battering ram</q> on the front or a pair of magnets.
    If you have the battering ram, then you will want the end of the track with the rubber nub at the bottom of the incline.
    If you have the magnets, then you need to replace the pulley with a <q>C</q> shaped <q>catch-bar.</q>
    <em>Ask for help from the instructor!</em>  The catch-bar has magnets in it that will repel the magnets in the cart.
    In this case, the cart must not be going so fast as to come into physical contact with the magnets on the catch-bar.</p>

    <p>Raise one end of the dynamics track.  <xref ref="q-slope" text="type-global" /> should help decide how tilted.
    Measure the tilt angle of the track with two methods: use a protractor, and measure the vertical rise and track length and
    calculate the tilt angle using the inverse-sine function.  Answer <xref ref="q-anglemeasurement" text="type-global" />.
    As you continue to set up the track for measurements, consider answering <xref ref="q-KE" text="type-global" />, <xref ref="q-PE" text="type-global" />,
    and <xref ref="q-2or1" text="type-global" /> again for this situation to help you decide on the appropriate accessories (sensors);
    but note <xref ref="q-rampangle" text="type-global" /> as you think about the answers to the previous questions.</p>

        <exercise xml:id="q-slope">
            <statement><p>  We want the cart to accelerate down the track (not too slow), but not to fly off
            at the bottom (not too fast).  How fast is <em>too fast</em>?  Don't use that slope!  How fast is <em>too slow</em>?
            Use a slope somewhere in between.</p></statement>
        </exercise>
        <exercise xml:id="q-anglemeasurement">
            <statement><p>  After you measure the angle of incline in these two ways, consider the

            <statement><p>  The motion sensor will measure the motion of the cart <em>along</em> the ramp,

            Which trig function relates the distance along the ramp to the corresponding vertical distance?</p></statement>
        </exercise>

    <p>Once you decide on the variables to be measured, but before you make the measurements,
    you will need to calibrate your position measurements.  We would like zero to correspond to being at the bottom of the ramp,
    so place the cart stationary at the bottom and use the motion sensor to measure this position.
    In order to verify the validity of the conservation of mechanical energy, release the cart from rest near the top of the ramp and
    let it roll down the incline, bouncing three times before you stop the measurement.  Do this for one value of mass.

            What do you notice about the mass?  Is your graph different if the mass of the cart changes?
            Does this support or conflict with the idea that the total mechanical energy is conserved?
            On the other hand, if the mechanical energy is not conserved, then

    <p>
    For the second week, you should already have your graphs from the experiment and you should have written a
    significant portion of the theory and the analysis.
    We are now going to take a closer look at the irregularities of the data and investigate some variations to try to
    explain what those data say.
    <ul>
    <li><p> One of the factors you were asked to consider last week was <xref ref="q-mass" text="type-global" />.
        In order to verify this, re-run <xref ref="sss-flat" text="type-global" /> with a noticeably different massed cart.
        Re-create the graph and use this only to note the effect of a different mass.  Answer <xref ref="q-mass2" text="type-global" />.
        </p></li>
    <li><p> Before drawing conclusions about the validity of the conservation of mechanical energy,
        consider <xref ref="q-missing" text="type-global" />. </p></li>
    </ul>
    </p>

        <exercise xml:id="q-missing">
            <statement><p> We need to look for the energy lost in each graph.
            <ol>
                <li><p> When you look at the graph from <xref ref="sss-flat" text="type-global" /> for <m>E</m>,
                    is the energy conserved or is there energy lost?
                    If lost, calculate the energy lost or gained from the graph. (It might help to have a trendline.)
                    If energy is lost, come up with at least two explanations for where this energy goes.</p></li>
                <li><p> When you look at the graph from <xref ref="sss-sloped" text="type-global" /> for <m>E</m>, there are jumps in the energy.  Why?
                    <ol>
                    <li><p> What is happening between the jumps?  Does <xref ref="sss-flat" text="type-global" /> help to
                        explain these sections of the graph?
                        Compared to the jumps, can we assume that the mechanical energy is conserved between the jumps?</p></li>

                        From the trend of the graph, calculate the amount of energy lost during each sudden change,
                        call it the energy discrepancy, and the percent of this discrepancy relative to the total energy
                        before the corresponding collision.   Discuss where this <q>missing</q> energy goes.
                        Is the ratio of <q>energy discrepancy</q> to total prior energy the same for each jump?</p></li>

                <li><p> Comment in general, on the law of Conservation of Mechanical Energy.
                    Can you predict any effects that might invalidate the conservation of mechanical energy?
                    Can these effects be minimized?  Is it possible to run the experiment again minimizing this effect?</p></li>
            </ol></p></statement>
        </exercise>

    <p>
    <ul>
    <li><p> As you evaluate <xref ref="sss-sloped" text="type-global" />, you might be asked to re-run the experiment with a force transducer
        placed at the bottom of the track.  (This should imply where the motion sensor will go.)
        Make sure that the cart will bounce from the force sensor. Make sure that the force sensor is zeroed before the start.
        There might be some information here based on work as a force-through-a-distance versus work as a change-in-energy.
        </p></li>
    <li><p> One explanation of a loss of energy (non-conservation) is friction.
        List all of the places where two pieces of material rub against each other.
        Since <m>F_f = \mu F_N</m>, do any of these locations have a normal force that can be varied?
        (Recall <xref ref="q-mass" text="type-global" /> and <xref ref="q-mass2" text="type-global" />.)
        <!-- (Note <xref ref="q-mass2" text="type-global" />.) -->
        As an independent measure of the amount of friction, we can also consider the actual acceleration versus the expected acceleration.
        <xref ref="q-accel" text="type-global" /> will help you determine the expected acceleration and the variable necessary to find it.
        <xref ref="q-fracc" text="type-global" /> will help decide on the relationship between the friction and the acceleration.

                less than the expected value?  Larger than the expected value?</p></statement>
        </exercise>
    <p><ul>
    <li><p> A second explanation for the loss of energy is that some component is gaining rotational kinetic energy.
        The formula for this is <m>K_R = \frac{1}{2} I \omega^2</m>, where <m>I</m> is the moment of
        inertia<fn>In this case, the moment of inertia is probably a little less than <m>\frac{1}{2} m r^2</m>,
            where <m>m</m> is the mass of the rotating object and <m>r</m> is the radius of the rotating object.

        Assuming that any discrepancy that you found in the conservation of energy is due to the rotational kinetic energy of the pulley,
        how much energy would the pulley need to have at the end of the run (while spinning full speed)?
        Based on the final velocity of the cart, what is the angular speed of the pulley?
        Based on these numbers, <m>K_R</m> and <m>\omega</m>, what is the moment of inertia for the pulley?
        Can you tell if this is a reasonable estimate?</p></li>

Because we do not have an independent verification of the value of the stiffness of the spring, we will need to be clever about how to verify the relevant equations.

<introduction><title>Introduction</title>

    <p>Oscillatory motion is one of the most common types of motions and can occur in any physical system.
    Mechanical systems can experience a periodic motion, and then will vibrate at a natural frequency.
    This phenomenon is called resonance.  Sound is a vibration in the air, which we hear with our ears;
    light is an oscillation of electric and magnetic fields, which we can see.  The atoms and molecules in
    all objects are in a state of continual vibration, which we can detect as the temperature of the object,
    and the atomic vibrations of a quartz crystal can be used as a very accurate timer.  The study of
    repetitive motion is not just an intellectual exercise, but actually enables us to model complicated
    systems with simple harmonic motion.</p>

    <p>In this lab, we will consider spring as an example of oscillation.  This oscillation is due to the
    elasticity of a spring.  We will need to measure the stiffness of the spring and relate this to the rate of oscillation.</p>

    <p>Most systems have elastic properties, such that when the system is deformed or vibrated,
    there is a force which tries to restore the system to its original state.  If the restoring
    force is proportional to the displacement from its equilibrium position, then the object is
    said to be in simple harmonic motion (SHM).  A linear restoring force can be expressed
    mathematically by the equation
    <men xml:id="eq-hooke">
    \vec F= -k\vec x \hspace{.5cm} \mbox{or as} \hspace{.5cm}  a= \frac{d^2x}{dt^2} = -\frac{kx}{m}
    </men>
    where <m>F</m> is the <term>restoring force</term>, <m>x</m> is the <term>elongation</term> (the displacement from the equilibrium position, which is also called the <q>zero position</q>), <m>k</m> is a proportionality constant, and the minus sign indicates that the
    restoring force is always opposite the direction of the displacement.  For a spring system, <m>k</m>
    is called the <term>spring constant</term>, and represents the ratio of the applied force to the elongation.
    The spring constant is an inherent physical property of the spring itself (an elastic property).
    The value of <m>k</m> gives a relative indication of the stiffness of the spring.  If the spring
    system is in equilibrium  <m>(\sum F_i =0)</m>  then the restoring force is equal to the force
    pulling on the spring, and this force is proportional to the extension of the spring from its equilibrium
    position.  This relationship for elastic behavior is known as Hooke's law, after Robert Hooke (1635-1703).
    </p>

        <p>We can investigate Hooke's law by hanging a mass on a spring, measuring the stretch, and plotting the mass versus the elongation.
        If we rewrite <xref ref="eq-hooke" text="type-global">Equation</xref> relating the mass to the elongation
        <men xml:id="eq-hooke-stretching"> m = \left[ \frac{k}{g} \right] x </men>
        then we see an equation of the form <m>y=mx+\cancelto{0}{b}</m>, where the slope depends on both <m>k</m> and <m>g</m>.</p>

<!-- <p>Notice that for the previous equation to be valid,  the acceleration must have the same functional form as the displacement.
    One function for which this would be true is the cosine function, that is, that both the acceleration and the displacement
    can be represented by cosine functions.</p>
    -->

    <p>Simple Harmonic Motion (SHM) systems can
    <!-- therefore -->
    be described by harmonic functions (cosines), where the displacement as a function of the time <m>x(t)</m> can be written as
    <me>	x(t) = A \cos(2\pi f t) </me>
    where <m>A</m> is the amplitude of the motion, and <m>f</m> is the frequency of the motion in units of cycles per second
    <m>(\mathrm{sec}^{-1})</m> commonly called a hertz (Hz) after Heinrich Hertz.
    The period (<m>T</m>, in units of seconds per cycle) equals the inverse of the frequency <m>(f)</m>,
    <m>T=\phantom{1}^1\!\!/_f</m>.  For a mass on a spring, the period <m>T</m> depends on the physical parameters of the system
    (the mass, and the spring constant), and can be given by
    <men xml:id="eq-hookeperiod"> T=2\pi \sqrt{\frac{m}{k}} </men>
    </p>

        <p xml:id="p-hooke-bouncing">We can investigate this relationship by bouncing a mass on a spring, measuring the period, and plotting the mass versus the period.
        If we rewrite <xref ref="eq-hookeperiod" text="global">Equation</xref> relating the mass to the period
        <men xml:id="eq-hooke-bouncing"> m = \left[ k \right] \left( \frac{T}{2\pi} \right)^2 </men>
        then we see an equation of the form <m>y=ax^2+\cancelto{0}{b}x+\cancelto{0}{c}</m>, where the coefficient only depends on <m>k</m>.  Although this is a nonlinear relationship, we can <xref ref="quadratic" text="title">linearize</xref> the expression to find the parameter (slope with uncertainty) more easily.  (See <xref ref="nonlinear" text="type-global" /> for more discussion.)  You may also note that <m>T/2\pi</m> is a more convenient variable than <m>T</m> by itself because it produces a slope equal to <m>k</m> rather than <m>k/(2\pi)^2</m>.</p>

        <p>When you compare these relationships of the spring, you should be able to find a value for the acceleration due to gravity as a verification of these two equations.</p>

    <subsection xml:id="sss-hooke"><title>Hooke's law</title>

        <p>We will first measure the elasticity of the spring, using <xref ref="eq-hooke" text="type-global">Equation</xref>.
        <ul>
            <li><p> With the available spring, attach it rigidly and hang it vertically against the Dynamics Track.
                Hang various masses and measure the elongation of the spring, to a maximum of 60 cm.
                Do not over stretch the spring.  Record the bottom end of the mass hanger for the initial reference position.
                If a tapered spring is used, the small end should be at the top.</p></li>
            <li><p> Measure the elongation both when the masses are added and then when they are removed.</p>
                <p><em>Perfectly elastic</em> objects (possibly your spring) will return to the exact same location when pulled
                with the same force whether they are being stretched out or being allowed to relax back after stretching.</p>
                <p>Objects that are elastic, but not perfectly elastic, will return to approximately the same location, but might retain some deformation.</p></li>
            <li><p> You will be graphing the relationship between the mass and the displacement, <xref ref="eq-hooke-stretching" text="title">Equation</xref>.</p></li>
        </ul>
        </p>

    </subsection>
    <subsection xml:id="sss-bounce"><title>Oscillating Spring</title>

    <p>We will next consider the periodicity of an oscillating spring.
    <ul>
        <li><p> With the same range of masses as in <xref ref="sss-hooke" text="type-global" />,  measure the period of oscillation for each mass.
        You <em>can</em> but do not <em>have to</em> use the same values of mass, as long as the set of masses sampled are in the same range.
        </p></li>
        <li><p> You will be graphing the relationship between the mass and the period, <xref ref="eq-hooke-bouncing" text="title">Equation</xref>.
            I <xref ref="p-hooke-bouncing" text="title">recommend</xref> using <m>T/(2\pi)</m> as the variable representing the period

<introduction><title>Introduction</title>

    <p>A simple pendulum consists of a small bob of mass <m>(m)</m> suspended by a light
    (assumed to be massless) string of length <m>(L)</m>, and the string is firmly attached at its upper end.
    This pendulum is a mechanical system which we will assume exhibits simple harmonic motion.
    That is, the restoring force on the pendulum is proportional to the displacement from the equilibrium position.</p>

    <p>Oscillatory motion is one of the most common types of motions and can occur in any physical system.
    Mechanical systems can experience a periodic motion, and then will vibrate at a natural frequency.
    This phenomenon is called resonance.  Sound is a vibration in the air, which we hear with our ears;
    light is an oscillation of electric and magnetic fields, which we can see.  The atoms and molecules in
    all objects are in a state of continual vibration, which we can detect as the temperature of the object,
    and the atomic vibrations of a quartz crystal can be used as a very accurate timer.  The study of
    repetitive motion is not just an intellectual exercise, but actually enables us to model complicated
    systems with simple harmonic motion.</p>

    <p>Galileo (1564-1642) investigated the natural motions of a simple pendulum.  From his observations he
    concluded that <q>vibrations of very large and very small amplitude all occupy the same time.</q>
    Galileo's time interval of measurement was his own pulse rate.  With today's modern technology we have
    much more precise measuring instruments.   This experiment will investigate the relationships between
    the physical characteristics of the pendulum and the period of the pendulum.</p>

</introduction>

<section xml:id="s-pendulum-procedure"><title>Procedure</title>

    <p>You will have available for your use:  pendulum bobs, string, timers, and a protractor.
    Be careful to fix the string to a point of support which will not move or vibrate as the pendulum swings.
    You will test each of the three relationships above (period vs amplitude, vs mass, and vs length).
    While measuring one relationship, you should ensure that -- if they matter -- then the other two variables are not varied.
    For example, when changing the pendulum mass do not vary the pendulum's length or its amplitude.</p>

    <p>Some considerations while doing this lab:
    <ul>
        <li><p> It turns out that the convenient quantity when graphing is not the period, <m>T</m>, but rather <m>T/(2\pi)</m>.</p></li>
        <li><p> The amplitude of oscillation is the maximum angle which the string makes from the vertical.</p></li>
        <li><p> In general when testing the mass or the length, it is best to keep the amplitude of oscillation small.</p></li>
        <li><p> When testing any of the relationships, you should measure a few widely-separated values.  If these seem to vary
            significantly, then fill in the gaps between those measurements to make a reliable graph.
            See <xref ref="q-howmany" text="global">Question</xref>.</p></li>
        <li><p> If you can prove that the period is not affected by one of these variables, then you do not need to worry about
            keeping it constant while you measure the other variables.</p></li>
        <li><p> Your graphical analysis will be better if your graph is linear.  Consider <xref ref="q-linpend" text="global">Question</xref> for advice on
            making your graphs.</p></li>

<appendix xml:id="a-report"><title>Writing a Lab Report</title>

        <p>A formal report will be required of each student for most experiments.  However, in some experiments, you will only be required to do a piece of the report so that you can develop a sense of what the sections should include.
        Reports should be written as if they will be read by a fellow student with similar class experience but who did not experience this particular experiment.</p>

        <p>The report is due
        by the end of the working day on Monday.
        <!-- at lecture-time four days from the date of the experiment.  -->
        (You should plan to turn it in before 4:30pm.)
        If you report is late, then you lose five additional points on every Thursday and Monday after the due date.
        Reports must be typed and can be submitted on paper or electronically.  If you submit the report by email, then I will reply with a "Thank you."  If you do not receive the thank-you, then you should assume that I did not receive your report.</p>

        <p>Lab reports will be graded on clarity (which includes your overall organization, your use of paragraphs, grammar, and spelling, as well as using the technical terms correctly) as well as on scientific content.  The report should
        contain the following sections (unless otherwise indicated for the specific lab exercise):
        <dl>
                <li><title><mdash /></title><p>Names of author <em>and co-experimenters</em>, name of experiment, date
                experiment was performed.</p></li>

                <li><title>Abstract</title>
                <p>An abstract is a brief summary of your report; it will be easiest to write this after you have written everything else, but it should be placed at the beginning of the report.
                Although it accompanies your report, it is not considered <em>part of</em> your report and should not be referred to by any other section of the report.
                The abstract should only be about three sentences long (a brief summary) and is usually organized as follows:
                        a simple statement of the objectives of the experiment,
                        followed by a simple statement what you measured in order to achieve that objective,
                        and ending with an indication of how successful your experiment was by citing the most important numerical results (with uncertainty).
                The important results are those that give evidence for your conclusion.  You may also include a relevant percent difference.</p>

                <p>The point of the abstract is to tell someone who is <em>already familiar</em> with the concept of your experiment how your specific experiment went.</p></li>

                <li><title>Apparatus</title>
                <p>A list of the equipment used in the experiment including a description of any new or unfamiliar pieces or of unusual uses of some familiar piece.  Diagrams should be given whenever it clarifies either what the equipment looks like or how it fits together to do the experiment.</p>

                <!-- The point of this record is to allow the later verification of your measurements. -->
                </li>

                <li><title>Theory</title>
                <p>Although the abstract captures the essence of the concept
                explored by this exercise, this section should explain the underlying concepts.
                It should be written to an audience with the background knowledge of one of
                your fellow students who has been in class with you, but was unable to attend
                this particular lab exercise.  You can treat ideas from class as familiar when
                you reference them, but some of these may still need an explanation to connect
                them to this experiment.  You should begin by stating the objectives of the
                experiment, the principle which you are trying to verify.  This might not
                be as simply stated as in the abstract since the goal here is to explain,
                rather than merely state, how it is that the principle can be proven.
                Once you have stated the objectives, you will <em>briefly</em> give the experiment
                a conceptual context by discussing the physical laws and concepts involved
                in reaching your objectives, by defining new terms, and by characterizing
                physical laws and relevant models.  Equations used should be derived in order
                to relate the form of the equation that expresses the principle (as presented in class)
                to the form of the equation that will be useful for your calculation.
                All variables should be identified and it is important to relate the
                equations used to the physical situations that they represent, while showing
                how measured variables can be related to the final calculated result.</p>

                <p>The point of the theory section is to connect what we knew before the lab
                to what we have discovered through the lab, to introduce the reader to the important
                ideas that can be applied to the physical relationships, to connect how the relationships
                (possibly expressed via equations) might be verified by considering a particular graph,
                and to compare what we should see if the theory is correct to what we might see
                if the theory were actually different than we are proposing.</p></li>

                <li><title>Procedure</title>
                <p>A brief outline of the experimental procedure.
                <alert>This must be in the student's own words</alert>, not copied or even transposed
                from the instruction sheets or from other laboratory manuals.  Apply the
                general ideas of the theory to justify or explain the specific steps.
                Note that scientific reports are generally written in the past tense,
                passive voice: <q>measurements of the half-life were made using the technique<ellipsis /></q>
                rather than the active voice: <q>we measure the half-life by<ellipsis /></q></p>

                <p>The points of this section are: to enable the reader to visualize which measurements
                were made and how they relate to the theory, to allow you to repeat the experiment
                at a later date, and to provide enough information that another student (who has not
                done the lab) to reconstruct your experiment.</p></li>

                <li><title>Data</title>
                <p>Provide a table of measured and calculated data including
                uncertainties and units.  Show how your calculations were performed.  Whenever
                possible, a graphical record of the data should be given.
                <!-- The original data sheet must have been turned in at the end of lab. -->
                Even if you did not measure the data in order smallest-to-largest,
                you should report it this way so that patterns in the data are obvious by
                glancing down the column.</p></li>

                <li><title>Analysis</title>
                <p>Analyze your data based on the predictions of the
                Theory Section.  Describe important features of the data and how they
                express various features of the theory,
                such as: Is the graph linear or quadratic? What are the slope and intercept?
                Is your result reasonable and consistent in the context of the theoretical expectations?
                Cite uncertainty or <percent />-uncertainty as applicable.
                Cite <percent />-error or <percent />-difference as applicable.
                Give a <em>quantitative</em> statement of the sources of uncertainty and their
                effect on the results of the experiment.  Explain the steps taken to
                minimize the uncertainties.</p>

                <p>The point of this section is to provide the connection between the data and
                the theory in order to draw a conclusion in the next section.</p></li>

                <li><title>Conclusions</title>
                <p>A brief discussion of what you can
                conclude <em>about</em> the initial assumptions and objectives <em>based on</em> the analysis.
                Reference the theory section as appropriate.
                Cite the relevant results from your analysis which support your conclusion.
                Why do these numbers support your conclusion?</p></li>

<appendix xml:id="uncertainties"> <title>Managing Uncertainties</title>

    <introduction>
        <p>One of the fundamental aspects of science is knowing the reliability of results.
        The mechanism for gaining this knowledge is first to gauge how well one knows any given measurement
        and then to propagate this to an indication of the reliability of the results that depend on those
        measurements.  The primary goal in attending to the propagation of the uncertainty is that it allows
        scientists to determine which measurement is causing the most uncertainty in the result so that
        future experimenters know which measurement to improve to get an improved result.</p>

        <p>In this section we will learn the terminology, determine how to gauge the measurement uncertainty,
        learn how to propogate this information through a calculation, and learn how to discuss this analysis
        in your lab reports.</p>
    </introduction>

    <section xml:id="s-uncertainty">
        <title>Experimental Uncertainties, Defining <q>Error</q></title>

            <p>Measurements are never exact.  For example, if one apple is divided among three people,
            your calculator will tell you that each person has <m>0.3333333333</m> of an apple.
            A measurement of each slice will tell you two pieces of information:
            (1) how many 3s to keep and
            (2) how well you know the final 3.
            In this example, both <m>0.33 \pm 0.01</m> and <m>0.33 \pm 0.04</m> imply that the measurement is accurate to two decimal places,
            but the first implies that you trust the second 3 more than if you report it as the second number.</p>
            <aside>
            <title>CAUTION:</title>
            <p>Because physicists <q>know what we mean</q>, they are often sloppy with their language and use
            the words <q>error</q> and <q>uncertainty</q> interchangeably.
            </p>
            </aside>

            <p>Some technical terms and their use in physics (which may differ from common use):
<dl>
            <li><title>accuracy</title>
            <p>How close a number is to the true (but usually unknowable) result.
            This is usually expressed by the (absolute or relative) error.
            </p></li>
            <li><title>precision</title>
            <p> How well you trust the measurement.
            This is vaguely expressed by the number of decimals, or clearly expressed by the size of the (absolute or relative) uncertainty.
            </p></li>
            <li><title>uncertainty</title>
            <p> The <term>uncertainty in a number</term> expresses the precision of a measurement or of a computed result.
            This can be expressed as the <term>absolute uncertainty</term> (explained in <xref ref="ss-precision" text="title" />), the <term>relative uncertainty</term>,
            or the <term>percent uncertainty</term>.

            <title>Writing an Analysis of Error</title>

            <introduction>

            <p>The conclusion of your lab report should be based on an analysis of the error in the experiment.
            The analysis of error is one of the most certain gauges available to the instructor by which the student's
            scientific insight can be evaluated.  To be done well, this analysis calls for comments about the factors
            that impacted the extent to which the experimental results agree with the theoretical value (what factors
            impact the percent error), the limitations and restrictions of the instruments used (what factors impact the
            uncertainty), and the legitimacy of the assumptions.</p>

            <p xml:id="p-source-of-error">Physicists usually use the phrase <q>sources of error</q> (or <q>sources of uncertainty</q>) to describe
            how the limits of measurement propagate through a calculation (see <xref ref="ss-propagation" text="title" />)
            to impact the <term>uncertainty</term> in the final result.  This type of <q>error analysis</q> gives insight into the
            <term>accuracy</term> of the result.  <xref ref="sss-considerations" text="title" /> provides questions that can help you
            describe which of several measurements can most effectively improve the <term>precision</term> of the result
            so that you can gain insight into the <term>accuracy</term> of the result.  The accuracy allows one to gauge
            the veracity (truth) of an underlying relationship, but precision allows you to gauge accuracy.  Said another
            way, a small <term>percent difference</term> usually is used to imply a small <term>percent error</term>.
            Said another way, imprecise measurements always <em>seem</em> accurate.</p>

            </introduction>

        <subsection xml:id="sss-mistakes">
            <title>Technically, Errors are not Mistakes</title>

            <p>Your report should not list <q>human error</q> because most students misunderstand this term to mean
            <q>places I might have made a mistake</q> rather than <q>the limiting factor when using the equipment correctly.</q>
            <xref ref="ss-precision" text="title" /> discusses measurement uncertainties as defined above.</p>

            <p>In the example of the apple above, the fact that one person has <m>0.33 \pm 0.04</m> of an apple does
            <em>not</em> reflect a <q>mistake</q> in the cutting, but rather reflects that the cutter is limited in their precision.
            What is important is to use the uncertainty to express how well one can repeated cut the apple into thirds.
            The absolute uncertainty of <m>0.04</m> is generally interpreted to say that most instances
            (roughly <m>68\%</m>, as explained in <xref ref="sss-multiple-precision" text="title" />) of the cutting of an apple in this way
            will result in having between <m>0.29</m> to <m>0.37</m> of an apple for any given slice.</p>

            <p xml:id="p-random-systematic">When describing the cause of an error (difference from the theoretical value) or of an uncertainty
            (the extent you trust a number), you can usually categorize this source of error as a random error
            (a cause that could skew the result too large <em>or</em> too small) or as a systematic error
            (a cause that tends to skew the result in one particular direction).
            <dl>
            <li><title>Random Error</title>
                <p> An environmental circumstances, generally uncontrollable, that sometimes makes the measured result too high and
                sometimes make it too low in an unpredictable fashion.  Random errors may have a statistical origin -- that is, they
                are due to chance.  For example, if one hundred pennies are dumped on a table, on average we expect that fifty would
                land heads up.  But we should not be surprised if fifty-three or forty-seven actually landed heads-up.
                This deviation is statistical in nature because the way in which a penny lands is due to chance.
                Random errors can sometimes be reduced by either collecting more data and averaging the readings,
                or by using instruments with greater precision.
                </p></li>
            <li xml:id="li-systematic-error"><title>Systematic Error</title>
                <p> A systematic error can be ascribed to a factor which would tend to push the result in a certain direction away
                from the theory value.  The error would make all of the results either systematically too high or systematically to low.
                One key idea here is that systematic errors can be eliminated or reduced if the factor causing the error can be
                eliminated or controlled.  This is sometimes a big <q>if</q>, because not all factors can be controlled.
                Systematic errors can be caused by instruments which are not calibrated correctly, maybe a <term>zero-point error</term>
                (an error with the zero reading of the instrument).  This type of error can usually be found and corrected.
                Systematic errors also often arise because the experimental setup is somehow different from that assumed in the theory.
                If the acceleration due to gravity was measured to be <m>9.52\unitfrac{m}{s^2}</m>
                with an experimental uncertainty (precision) of <m>0.05\unitfrac{m}{s^2}</m>,
                rather than the textbook value of <m>9.81\unitfrac{m}{s^2}</m>,
                then we should be concerned with why the accuracy is
                not as good as the precision.  This is most likely to mean that there is a significant systematic error in the experiment,
                where one of the initial assumptions may not be valid.  The textbook value does not consider the effects of the air.
                The effects of the air may or may not be controllable, and the difference between the theory and the data may be
                (within appropriate limits or tests) considered a correction factor for the systematic error.

        <title>Considerations for the Error Analysis</title>

        <p> In order to help you get started on your  discussion of error, the following list of questions is provided.
        It is not an exhaustive list.  You need not answer all of these questions in a single report.
        <ol>

            <li><p> Was the experimental technique sensitive enough? Was the effect masked by noise? </p></li>
            </ol> </p></li>
        <li><p> Is it possible to determine which measurements are responsible for greater percent error by checking items
        measured and reasoning from the physical principles, the nature of the measuring instrument, and using the rules
        for propagation of error?
            <ol>
            <li><p> Is the error partly attributable to the fact that the experimental set-up did not approximate the ideal
            that was required by the physical theory closely enough? How did it fail? </p></li>
            <li><p> If a systematic error skews high (low), then is your result too high (low)?
            Is this a reasonable explanation?  Is the size of the skew enough to explain the result? </p></li>
            <li><p> What can be done to improve the equipment and eliminate error? How can the influence of environmental factors be diminished?
            Why is this so? </p></li>

    <title>Finding the Precision of a Measurement</title>

        <subsection xml:id="sss-single-precision">
        <title>Uncertainty of a single measurement</title>

        <p>All equipment has a finite precision.  For example, if you are stepping off the length of a room by placing one foot in front of the other and counting steps, then you are measuring in <q>shoe-lengths</q>.  You can likely estimate a half-show length or a third-of-a-shoe-length, but it might be difficult to accurately gauge smaller intervals of a shoe-length.  Conveniently for me, my size 11 shoe is <m>12 \unit{in}</m> long.  So, I can replace a shoe-length with a <q>foot</q>.  Furthermore, I could replace my measurement technique with a yard-stick (or better yet a meterstick).  Since a meter-stick has increments of millimeters on it, it is straightforward to measure the distance to the nearest millimeter.  In fact, you can probably guess the nearest half-millimeter.  The uncertainty in your shoe-measurement is about <m>4 \unit{in}</m> (or about <m>10\unit{cm} = 100 \unit{mm}</m>).  The uncertainty in the meter-stick measurement is about <m>0.5\unit{mm}</m>, significantly better than your shoe.</p>

        <p>In addition, to how well the equipment can make a measurement, there is also how well you can gauge the measurement with that piece of equipment.  If you measure the length of the room using <m>12\unit{in}</m> rulers, then you will need quite a few of them.  It is possible that with so many individual rulers, you will either not measure in exactly a straight line or you might not be able to keep the rulers exactly parallel to each other.  Both of these (inappropriate but difficult to control) uses of the rulers will introduce error and, since you can't necessarily judge if you are doing this (especially since you are trying to not do so), you are introducing uncertainty.  You do not necessarily know what errors are actually happening when they are so small.  Nonetheless, you need to account for the possibility of such errors in your uncertainty.  (Recall the types of error in <xref ref="sss-mistakes" text="title" />.)  In each of the cases mentioned here, the error would necessarily increase the measurement value to a number larger than the actual value.  There are other instances (perhaps using a string to measure distance and mis-gauging the tautness of the string) where the value might be systematically small or perhaps randomly distributed.</p>

        <p>To get a sense of how large the possible variations are due to this measurement uncertainty, it is advisable to always take more data.  Having more data is always better (statistically).  If you measure a quantity many times and you do not see any variation, then the precision of the instrument dominates the uncertainty; that is, your instrument is less precise than your technique.  If you measure a quantity many times and see some variation, then your measurement technique dominates the uncertainty; that is, your technique is less precise than your instrument.  Usually the actual uncertainty will be a combination of both.  For our purposes, we will consider 10-20 measurements to be <q>many</q>, and hope it is sufficient.  If you are asked to do a lab exercise on <q>Standard Deviation</q>, then you will explore what a <q>sufficient number of measurements</q> means.</p>

        <p>In the next subsection (<xref ref="sss-multiple-precision" text="title" />), we will discuss how to do the statistics to account for multiple measurements.</p>

        </subsection>

        <subsection xml:id="sss-multiple-precision">
        <title>Uncertainty of multiple, repeated measurements</title>

        <p>Calculate or estimate the precision of a measurement by one or more of the following methods:
        <ol>
        <li><p> by the precision of the measuring instrument, and take into account any uncertainties that are intrinsic to the object itself; </p></li>
        <li><p> by the range of values obtained, the minimum and/or maximum deviation <m>(d)</m>;
            <me> d_i = \left| X_i - X_{\rm ave} \right| </me>  </p></li>
        <li><p> by the standard deviation, which is the square root of the sum of the squares of the individual deviations <m>(d)</m>
        divided by the number of readings <m>(N)</m> minus one;
            <me> \sigma = \sqrt{\frac{1}{(N-1)} \sum d^2} = \sqrt{\frac{1}{(N-1)} \sum_i \left| X_i - X_{\rm ave} \right|^2} </me> </p></li>
        <li><p> by the standard deviation of the mean, which is the standard deviation divided by the square root of the number of readings; </p></li>
        <li><p> by the square root of the number of readings <m>(\sqrt{N})</m>, if <m>N</m> is considered large; </p></li>
        </ol></p>

        <p>If many data points were taken and plotted on a histogram, it would smooth out and approach the symmetrical graph typical
        of the binomial distribution (see the Figure <xref ref="f-histogram" /><!-- on page~\pageref{f:histogram} -->).
        This distribution and many others in statistics may be approximated by the gaussian distribution. </p>

        <figure xml:id="f-histogram">
        <title>A sample histogram</title>
        <caption>
        A sample histogram for the number of darts binned by distance from the centerline.
        </caption>
        <image source="images/darthistogram.jpg" width="100%" />
        </figure>

        <p> The standard deviation, <m>\sigma</m>, can be estimated from the above graph.  It is a measure of the <q>width</q> of the distribution.
        For the case shown, the standard deviation has the value of five.  The greater the standard deviation, the wider the distribution
        and the less likely that an individual reading will be close to the average value.  About <m>68\%</m> of the individual readings fall
        within one standard deviation (between 45 and 55 in this case).  About <m>96\%</m> of the readings fall within two standard deviations
        (between 40 and 60 in this case). </p>

        <p> As more and more readings are taken, the effect of the random error is gradually eliminated.
        In the absence of systematic error, the average value of the readings should gradually approach the true value.
        The smooth curve above was drawn assuming that there was no systematic error.
        If there were, the graph would merely be displaced sideways.  The average value for the number would then be say 55. </p>

        <p> The distribution of many average (mean) readings is also gaussian in shape.
        Comparing this to the distribution for individual readings, it is much narrower.
        We would expect this, since each reading on this graph is an average of individual readings and has much less random error.
        By taking an average of readings, a considerable portion of the random error has been canceled.
        The standard deviation for this distribution is called the standard deviation of the mean (<m>\sigma_m</m>).
        For this distribution, <m>68\%</m> of the averages of the readings are within one standard deviation of the mean,
        and <m>98\%</m> of the average readings fall within two standard deviations of the mean. </p>


        <p> The standard deviation of the mean tells how close a particular <em>average</em> of several readings is likely to be
        to an overall average when many readings are taken.  The standard deviation tells how close an <em>individual</em> reading
        is likely to be to the average.</p>

        <p>There is one case for which the standard deviation can be estimated from one reading.  In counting experiments
        (radioactivity, for example), the distribution is a Poisson distribution.  For this distribution, the standard deviation
        is just the square root of the average reading.  One reading can give an estimate of the average, and therefore, give an
        estimate of-the standard deviation.</p>

    <section xml:id="ss-propagation">
    <title>Propagation of Uncertainties</title>

    <p> The previous sections discussed the uncertainties of directly measured quantities.
    Now we need to consider how these uncertainties affect the rest of the analysis.
    In most experiments, the analysis or final results are obtained by adding, subtracting, multiplying, or dividing the primary data.
    The uncertainty in the final result is therefore a combination of the errors in the primary data.
    The way in which the error propagates from the primary data through the calculations to the final result may be summarized as follows:
    <ol>
    <li xml:id="add"><p> The error to be assigned to the sum or difference of two quantities is equal to the sum of their absolute errors. </p></li>
    <li xml:id="mult"><p> Relative error is the ratio of the absolute error to the quantity itself.
    The relative error to be assigned to the product or quotient of two quantities is the sum of their relative errors.</p></li>
    <li><p> The relative error to be assigned to the power of a quantity is the power times the relative error of the quantity itself.</p></li>
    </ol>
    These rules are not arbitrary, but rather they follow directly from the nature of the mathematical operations.
    These rules may be derived using calculus.  </p>

    <title>Significant Figures only <em>approximates</em> Uncertainty</title>

    <p> The precision/accuracy of any measurement or number is approximated by writing the number with a convention called using
    <term>significant figures</term>.  Every measuring instrument can be read with only so much precision and no more.
    For example, a meter stick can be used to measure the length of a small metal rod to one-tenth of a millimeter,
    whereas a micrometer can be used to measure the length to one-thousandth of a millimeter.
    When reporting these two measurements, the precision is indicated by the number of digits used to express the result.
    You should always record your data and results using the convention of significant figures.
    </p>

    <p> To give a specific example, suppose that the rod mentioned above was <m>52.430\unit{mm}</m> long.
    When making this measurement with the meter stick, you would count off the total number of millimeters in the
    length of the rod and then add your best guess that the rod was four-tenths of a millimeter longer than that.
    Using the micrometer, you would count off the hundredths of a millimeter and then add your best guess of the
    number of thousandths of a millimeter, to complete the measurement.  How would you communicate the fact that
    one measurement is more precise than the other?  If you wrote both quantities in the same way, you could not tell which was which.
    </p>

    <p> The rules for <term>significant figures</term>:
    <!-- These need to be conventions, not asides -->
    <ol>
    <li xml:id="sig-rule-first-digit"><p>Significant figures include all certain digits plus the first of the doubtful digits. (Note <xref ref="convention-first-digit" text="type-global" />.) </p></li>
    <li xml:id="sig-rule-zero"><p>Zeros to the right of the number are significant; zeros on the left are not.  (Note <xref ref="convention-zero" text="type-global" /> and <xref ref="ex-zero" text="type-global" />.) </p></li>
    <li xml:id="sig-rule-rounding"><p>Round the number, increasing by one the last digit retained if the following digit is greater than five.  (Note <xref ref="convention-rounding" text="type-global" />.) </p></li>
    <li><p>In addition and subtraction, carry the result only up to the first doubtful decimal place of any of the starting numbers.</p></li>
    <li><p>In multiplication and division, retain as many significant figures in the answer as there are in the starting number with the smallest number of significant figures.</p></li>
    </ol>
    </p>

    <convention xml:id="convention-first-digit"><title>One doubtful digit</title>
            <p>(Note <xref ref="sig-rule-first-digit" text="global">Rule</xref>.) The reading obtained from the meter stick would be written as 52.4 mm;
            all digits up to and including the first doubtful digit.  The reading from the micrometer would be written as 52.430 mm.
            The first doubtful digit in the case of the meter stick is .4 mm.  The first doubtful digit in the case of the micrometer
            is zero-thousandths of a millimeter.  Note that the number of significant figures is related to the precision of the
            measuring instrument -- it is not an abstraction about the number.</p>
            <p>Sometimes the character zero is confusing.  See <xref ref="sig-rule-zero">Rule</xref>.</p>
    </convention>

    <convention xml:id="convention-zero"><title>Dealing with Zero</title>
            <p>(Note <xref ref="sig-rule-zero" text="global">Rule</xref> and <xref ref="ex-zero" text="type-global" />.) In the example above, the reading of the micrometer was given as 52.430 mm.
            The zero is a significant figure, it communicates the fact that the micrometer measurement is good to a thousandth of a millimeter.
            Zeros used to the left of significant digits to position the decimal point are not significant.
            They are not communicating the precision of the measurement.  For example, if the measurement from the meter stick were
            written as 0.0524 meter, the zeros would not be significant digits.  Because of the units (meters instead of millimeters),
            the decimal point had to be moved to the left.  This measurement still has only three significant figures.</p>
    </convention>

    <example xml:id="ex-zero"><title>Handling Zero</title>
            <statement><p>Suppose that you wished to give the meter stick measurement in terms of microns <m>(\mu)</m>
            (1 micron = 1 millionth of a meter).   We determined that the meter stick reading has 3 sig. figs.,
            one good way to write this  is to use scientific notation.  Write the number as <m>5.24\ten{4}\unit{microns}</m>.
            The factor of <m>10^4</m> shows the order of magnitude, while the <m>5.24</m> retains the proper number of significant figures.

            <p>Because all measurements are limited in their precision, then all results derived from these measurements are also
            limited in their precision.  Many students get carried away with the number of digits produced by a calculator and
            mislead the reader by reporting their results with more significant figures than their data permits.
            Form the habit of rejecting all figures which will have no influence in the final result and report the result with only
            the number of significant digits allowed by the data.  The following rules will help you do this successfully.
            </p></statement>
    </example>


    <convention xml:id="convention-rounding"><title>Rounding</title>
            <p>(Note <xref ref="sig-rule-rounding" text="global">Rule</xref>.) Because the use of significant digits is meant to be an approximation to the more precise
            use of measurement uncertainty, the convention for the rounding of the final digit is not critical and is treated a little
            differently by different scientists.  Some round-up anything five-or-more.  Some round-down anything five-or-less.
            Some round the five up or down based on whether the next digit is even or odd.  This third choice is intended to express that
            we don't actually know which way to round it and letting the randomness of the next digit make the determination is like
            flipping a coin. <alert>You should ask your instructor, which approach they prefer.</alert></p>
    </convention>

    <p>When determining or estimating the experimental uncertainty, the precision of the measuring instrument is important,
    as shown in the above examples.  But you must also be aware of other experimental factors.  For example, a good stopwatch
    may have a precision of 0.01 seconds.  Is this the total uncertainty of the measurement?  You must remember that our
    physical reaction time maybe another 0.3 seconds.  This is more than 10 times larger than the precision of the timer.
    This is very significant.   Another example is trying to measure the diameter of a fuzzy cotton ball with a micrometer.
    Why is this not a very productive procedure?  There are major uncertainties here that are intrinsic to the object itself
    and are unrelated to the measuring instrument.  One must use common sense when estimating these uncertainties.
    </p>

    <p>The <term>actual uncertainty</term> written in the units of the measurement, may not convey a sense of how good the precision is.
    A better measure of the precision is given by the relative uncertainty.  This is defined as the actual uncertainty divided by
    the measurement itself and multiplied by 100, the <term>relative uncertainty</term> does not carry any units, just a <m>\%</m>.

<appendix xml:id="graphics"> <title>Discovering Relationships -- Graphical Analysis</title>

    <introduction>
    <p>The primary purpose of experimentation is to discover relationships between various physical quantities.
    This is usually best achieved with a graphical analysis.  Graphs of data and/or graphs of other results can be very enlightening.
    We often try to choose to plot variables for a graph so that the resulting relationship is linear, whose slope and intercept
    may be of physical interest.
    </p></introduction>

    <section xml:id="ss-linear">
    <title>Linear Relationships</title>

    <p>When two quantities are related, there are many, many possible mathematical relationships.
    The simplest relationship is the direct proportion.  This relationship is represented on a graph by a straight line
    which goes through the origin.  The linear relationship is similar, it however, may have an intercept with a coordinate axes.
    The general equation for a straight line is:
    <me>	y = mx + b, </me>
    where <m>x</m> and <m>y</m> are the plotted quantities, <m>m</m> is the slope, <m>b</m> is the <m>y</m>-intercept.
    The slope and intercepts of a linear relationship often have physical significance.  It is therefore very important to calculate
    the slope and intercept and then for you to interpret their meaning, and  always give the units of the slope and intercept.
    The slope can be computed by choosing two places, <m>(x_1,y_1)</m> and <m>(x_2,y_2)</m>, on the straight line.
    The slope is then given by
    <me> m  =  \frac{y_2-y_1}{x_2-x_1} </me>
    </p>

    </section>

    <section xml:id="nonlinear">
    <title>Linearizing Non-Linear graphs</title>

    <p>Most relationships which are not linear, can be graphed so that the graph is a straight line.
    This process is called a linearization of the data.  This does not change the fundamental relationship or what it represents,
    but it does change how the graph looks. The advantage of linearizing non-linear data is that the analysis of the parameters (slope and intercept) becomes significantly easier.
    Linear regression, which allows us to compute uncertainties in the slope and intercept as well as evaluating deviations from the equation (with residual plots), can be done by Pasco Capstone and Microsoft Excel; but, nonlinear regression requires specialized statistical software or lots of additional formulaic computations.
    </p>

    <p xml:id="inverse">For example, the equation
    <me> X \times Y = \mbox{constant} </me>
    represents an <em>inverse proportion</em> between <m>X</m> and <m>Y</m>.
    A graph of this equation is not a straight line with a negative slope.  Think about this and sketch the curve for yourself.
    This relationship can be graphed in such a way so that the new graph is a straight line.  This change is accomplished by
    choosing a new set of axes, and plotting new numbers which are related to the original set.  In this case if we would plot
    <m>1/X</m> on the x-axis instead of just <m>X</m>, this will yield a straight line graph.  Try it.
    </p>

    <p xml:id="quadratic">As another example, the equation
    <me> y = a x^2 </me>
    represents (a special case of) a <em>quadratic relationship </em> between <m>x</m> and <m>y</m>.
    A graph of this equation is not a straight line; however, this relationship can be graphed in such a way so that the new graph is a straight line.
    This change is accomplished by choosing a new set of axes, and plotting new numbers which are related to the original set.  In this case, if we would plot
    <m>(x^2)</m> on the x-axis instead of just <m>x</m>, this will yield a straight line graph.  Try it.
    </p>


    <p>There are many other possible relationships which are easy to linearize.  These include: exponential function,
    trigonometric functions, and power functions (squares, square roots, etc.)  A change of either the x or y-axis may
    linearize a function for you.
    </p>

    <sidebyside widths="47% 47%" >
        <p xml:id="power">To linearize the <em>power relationship</em>
        <me> Y = Bx^M,</me>
        take the natural logarithms of both sides to obtain
        <me> \ln(Y) = \ln(B) + M \ln(X).</me>
        If one plots <m>\ln(Y)</m> on the vertical and <m>\ln(X)</m> on the horizontal (a <q>log-log</q> graph),
        then the graph of this function yields a straight line with slope <m>M</m> and intercept <m>\ln(B)</m>.

        <p xml:id="exponential">To linearize the <em>exponential relationship</em>,

        take the logarithm of both sides to obtain

        and again a graph of this function yields a straight line graph.
        If one plots <m>\ln(Y)</m> on the vertical and <m>X</m> on the horizontal (a <q>semi-log</q> graph),
        then the graph of this function yields a straight line with slope <m>M</m> and intercept <m>\ln(B)</m>.
